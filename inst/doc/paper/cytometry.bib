@article{Lo2008,
	Abstract = {The capability of flow cytometry to offer rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells has made this technology indispensable for health research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box-Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis.},

@article{Boddy2001,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analytical flow cytometry (AFC), by quantifying sometimes
	more than 10 optical parameters on cells at rates of approximately
	10(3) cells/s, rapidly generates vast quantities of multidimensional
	data, which provides a considerable challenge for data analysis.
	We review the application of multivariate data analysis and pattern
	recognition techniques to flow cytometry. METHODS: Approaches were
	divided into two broad types depending on whether the aim was identification
	or clustering. Multivariate statistical approaches, supervised artificial
	neural networks (ANNs), problems of overlapping character distributions,
	unbounded data sets, missing parameters, scaling up, and estimating
	proportions of different types of cells comprised the first category.
	Classic clustering methods, fuzzy clustering, and unsupervised ANNs
	comprised the second category.We demonstrate the state of the art
	by using AFC data on marine phytoplankton populations. RESULTS AND
	CONCLUSIONS: Information held within the large quantities of data
	generated by AFC was tractable using ANNs, but for field studies
	the problem of obtaining suitable training data needs to be resolved,
	and coping with an almost infinite number of cell categories needs
	further research},

	modality in the management of different hematologic malignancies.
	Despite adequate posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy, acute
	graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity
	and mortality in the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation setting,
	even in patients who receive human leukemic antigen (HLA) identical
	sibling grafts. Up to 30\% of the recipients of stem cells or bone
	marrow transplantation from HLA-identical related donors and most
	patients who receive cells from other sources (matched-unrelated,
	non-HLA-identical siblings, cord blood) will develop > Grade 2 acute
	GVHD despite immunosuppressive prophylaxis. Thus, GVHD continues
	to be a major limitation to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
	In this review, the authors summarize the most current knowledge
	on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of

@article{Goker2001,
	Abstract = {Acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a major obstacle to safe allogeneic
	hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), leading to a significant
	morbidity and mortality. GVHD occurs when transplanted donor T lymphocytes
	react to foreign host cells. It causes a wide variety of host tissue
	injuries. This review focuses on the pathobiological basis, clinical
	aspects, and current management strategies of acute GVHD. Afferent
	phase of acute GVHD starts with myeloablative conditioning, i.e.,
	before the infusion of the graft. Total-body irradiation (TBI) or
	high-dose chemotherapy regimens cause extensive damage and activation
	in host tissues, which release inflammatory cytokines and enhance
	recipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Recognition
	of the foreign host antigens by donor T cells and activation, stimulation,
	and proliferation of T cells is crucial in the afferent phase. Effector
	phase of acute GVHD results in direct and indirect damage to host
	cells. The skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver are major target
	organs of acute GVHD. Combination drug prophylaxis in GVHD is essential
	in all patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Steroids have remained
	the standard for the treatment of acute GVHD. Several clinical trials
	have evaluated monoclonal antibodies or receptor antagonist therapy
	for steroid-resistant acute GVHD, with different successes in a variety
	of settings. There are some newer promising agents like mycophenolate
	mofetil, glutamic acid-lysine-alanine-tyrosine (GLAT), rapamycin,
	and trimetrexate currently entering in the clinical studies, and
	other agents are in development. Future experimental and clinical
	studies on GVHD will shed further light on the better understanding
	of the disease pathobiology and generate the tools to treat malignant
	disorders with allogeneic HSCT with specific graft-vs-tumor effects
	devoid of GVHD.},

@article{Hengel2001,
	Abstract = {Flow cytometry has played an invaluable role in recent advances made
	against HIV and AIDS, and there is every reason to expect it will
	continue to do so. Newer-generation machines, using three- and four-color
	panels, make measurements of lymphocyte subsets ever more accurate
	and potentially cost-effective. Similarly, recent single-platform
	techniques promise even more efficiencies, freeing CD4 enumeration
	from parallel determination of the CBC. In other developments, quantitative
	reporting of immunophenotype may well change the way subsets traditionally
	defined by qualitative determinations are viewed. The most promising
	initial candidates for such changes are surrogates of immune activation,
	such as CD38 expression on CD8 cells. But technical demonstration
	of reproducibility and reliability, and clinical trial evidence of
	utility--especially as measured against such established laboratory
	parameters as CD4 cell and HIV RNA determinations--are needed before
	a change from qualitative to quantitative immunophenotype measurement
	can be widely accepted. Although too soon to tell if they will emerge
	from the research arena into the clinical arena, tetramer binding,
	intracellular cytokine detection, and assays of cell division are
	rapidly advancing understanding of HIV-disease, and indeed understanding
	of all of human immunology. Some of these assays provide often subtly
	different information, and together they will help determine the
	most important surrogate measures of clinical immunity. Identifying
	such surrogates is critical to developing a rational HIV vaccine.
	The power of flow cytometry is its ability simultaneously to analyze
	data in four, five, six, or more dimensions. For longitudinal experiments,
	time adds yet another dimension. Humans struggle to think past three
	dimensions; interpreting results from experimental permutations and
	combinations that expand geometrically with each additional parameter
	studied requires considerable effort. Ultimately computer programs
	might come to our aid, but for now we have to live with the information
	overload if we hope to gain insight into the workings of complex
	biologic systems. In a world of limited resources, and with limited
	capacity to conceptualize in multiple dimensions, insight, inspiration,
	and perhaps a little luck are needed to ask the right questions and
	use the right assays if the recent string of advances against AIDS
	is to continue},

	Abstract = {The Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) was invented in the
	late 1960s by Bonner, Sweet, Hulett, Herzenberg, and others to do
	flow cytometry and cell sorting of viable cells. Becton Dickinson
	Immunocytometry Systems introduced the commercial machines in the
	early 1970s, using the Stanford patent and expertise supplied by
	the Herzenberg Laboratory and a Becton Dickinson engineering group
	under Bernie Shoor. Over the years, we have increased the number
	of measured FACS dimensions (parameters) and the speed of sorting
	to where we now simultaneously measure 12 fluorescent colors plus
	2 scatter parameters. In this history, I illustrate the great utility
	of this state-of-the-art instrument, which allows us to simultaneously
	stain, analyze, and then sort cells from small samples of human blood
	cells from AIDS patients, infants, stem cell transplant patients,
	and others. I also illustrate analysis and sorting of multiple subpopulations
	of lymphocytes by use of 8-12 colors. In addition, I review single
	cell sorting used to clone and analyze hybridomas and discuss other
	applications of FACS developed over the past 30 years, as well as
	give our ideas on the future of FACS. These ideas are currently being
	implemented in new programs using the internet for data storage and
	analysis as well as developing new fluorochromes, e.g., green fluorescent
	protein and tandem dyes, with applications in such areas as apoptosis,
	gene expression, cytokine expression, cell biochemistry, redox regulation,
	and AIDS. Finally, I describe new FACS methods for measuring activated
	kinases and phosphatases and redox active enzymes in individual cells
	simultaneously with cell surface phenotyping. Thus, key functions
	can be studied in various subsets of cells without the need for prior
	sorting},

	primary immunodeficiency diseases requires the use of several laboratory
	tests. Flow cytometry has become an important part of the workup
	of individuals suspected to have such a disorder. Knowledge of the
	pathogenesis of many of these diseases continues to increase, hence

@article{Kiechle2003,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the advances in clinically useful molecular biologic
	techniques and to identify their applications in clinical practice,
	as presented at the 11th Annual William Beaumont Hospital DNA Symposium.
	DATA SOURCES: The 8 manuscripts submitted were reviewed, and their
	major findings were compared with literature on the same or related
	topics. STUDY SELECTION: Manuscripts address the use of molecular
	techniques in microbiology to evaluate infectious disease and epidemiology;
	molecular microbiology methods, including rapid-cycle real-time polymerase
	chain reaction; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
	as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease or
	colon cancer; the effect of nonapoptotic doses of the bisbenizamide
	dye Hoechst 33342 on luciferase expression in plasmid-transfected
	BC3H-1 myocytes; the routine use of cystic fibrosis screening and
	its challenges; and the use of flow cytometry and/or chromosomal
	translocation in the diagnostic evaluation of hematopoietic malignancies.
	DATA SYNTHESIS: Three current issues related to the use of molecular
	tests in clinical laboratories are (1) the restriction on introducing
	new tests secondary to existing patents or licenses; (2) the preanalytic
	variables for the different specimen types currently in use, including
	whole blood, plasma, serum, fresh or frozen tissues, and free-circulating
	DNA; and (3) the interpretation of studies evaluating the association
	of complex diseases with a single mutation or single-nucleotide polymorphism.
	Molecular methods have had a major impact on infectious disease through
	the rapid identification of organisms, the evaluation of outbreaks,
	and the characterization of drug resistance when compared with standard
	culture techniques. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
	receptor gamma stimulated by thiazolidinedione is useful in the treatment
	of type II diabetes mellitus and may have value in preventing inflammatory
	bowel disease or colon cancer. Hoechst 33342 binding to adenine-thymine-rich
	regions in the minor groove of DNA is a fluorescent stain for DNA
	and initiates apoptosis at >10 microg/mL. Lower doses of Hoechst
	33342 promote luciferase expression by a mechanism that may involve
	binding to cryptic promoters facilitated by dye-associated misalignment
	of the tertiary structure of DNA. The routine use of cystic fibrosis
	screening is complicated by the more than 1000 mutations associated
	with the disease. The use of 4-color flow cytometry and the detection
	of chromosomal translocation are both invaluable aids in establishing
	the diagnosis of lymphoid or myeloid hematopoietic malignancies.
	CONCLUSIONS: The current postgenomic era will continue to emphasize
	the use of microarrays and database software for genomic, transcriptomic,
	and proteomic screening in the search for useful clinical assays.
	The number of molecular pathologic techniques will expand as additional
	disease-associated mutations are defined},

	Abstract = {Analysis of protein phosphorylation with flow cytometric techniques
	has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of immunological signaling,
	allowing cellular subsets in complex populations to be analyzed accurately
	and rapidly. In this review, we examine the development of phospho-epitope,
	or phospho-specific, flow cytometry and the premises upon which the
	technique is based. Phospho-specific flow cytometry is compared to
	traditional biochemical methods, and its advantages, such as single
	cell analysis, multiparameter data acquisition, rapid protocols,
	and the ability to analyze rare cell subsets, are detailed. We also
	discuss the many technical considerations that must be addressed
	when developing new antibodies or analyzing new epitopes including
	antigen accessibility, stability of the phospho-epitope, fluorophore
	selection, surface phenotype integrity, and antibody suitability
	for staining epitopes inside fixed and permeabilized cells. The methods
	that have been used to date are described in light of these technical
	considerations. The importance of developing bioinformatic platforms
	in parallel with these techniques is emphasized due to the large,
	multiparameter datasets that are rapidly accumulated and which require
	more efficient data viewing and complex clustering methods than currently
	available for flow cytometric data. Finally, we discuss the potential

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: This paper introduces the software EMMIX-GENE that has
	been developed for the specific purpose of a model-based approach
	to the clustering of microarray expression data, in particular, of
	tissue samples on a very large number of genes. The latter is a nonstandard
	problem in parametric cluster analysis because the dimension of the
	feature space (the number of genes) is typically much greater than
	the number of tissues. A feasible approach is provided by first selecting
	a subset of the genes relevant for the clustering of the tissue samples
	by fitting mixtures of t distributions to rank the genes in order
	of increasing size of the likelihood ratio statistic for the test
	of one versus two components in the mixture model. The imposition
	of a threshold on the likelihood ratio statistic used in conjunction
	with a threshold on the size of a cluster allows the selection of
	a relevant set of genes. However, even this reduced set of genes
	will usually be too large for a normal mixture model to be fitted
	directly to the tissues, and so the use of mixtures of factor analyzers
	is exploited to reduce effectively the dimension of the feature space
	of genes. RESULTS: The usefulness of the EMMIX-GENE approach for
	the clustering of tissue samples is demonstrated on two well-known
	data sets on colon and leukaemia tissues. For both data sets, relevant
	subsets of the genes are able to be selected that reveal interesting
	clusterings of the tissues that are either consistent with the external
	classification of the tissues or with background and biological knowledge
	of these sets. AVAILABILITY: EMMIX-GENE is available at http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~gjm/emmix-gene/},

@article{Roederer2001a,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In multivariate distributions (for example, in 3- or more
	color flow cytometric datasets), it can become difficult or impossible
	to identify populations that differ between samples based only on
	a combination of univariate or bivariate displays. Indeed, it is
	possible that such differences can only be identified in "n"-dimensional
	space, where "n" is the number of parameters measured. Therefore,
	computer assisted identification of such differences is necessary.
	Such a method could be used to identify responses (i.e., by comparing
	cell samples before and after stimulation) in exquisite detail by
	allowing complete analysis of the collected data on only those events
	which have responded. METHODS: Multivariate Probability Binning can
	be used to compare different datasets to identify the distance and
	statistical significance of a difference between the distributions.
	An intermediate step in the algorithm provides access to the actual
	locations within the n-dimensional comparison which are most different
	between the distributions. Gates based on collections of hyper-rectangular
	bins can then be applied to datasets, thereby selecting those events
	(or clusters of events) that are different between samples. We term
	this process Frequency Difference Gating. RESULTS: Frequency Difference
	Gating was used in several test scenarios to evaluate its utility.
	First, we compared PBMC subsets identified by solely by immunofluorescence
	staining: based on this training data set, the algorithm automatically
	generated an accurate forward and side-scatter gate to identify lymphocytes.
	Second, we applied the algorithm to identify subtle differences between
	CD4 memory subsets based on 8-color immunophenotyping data. The resulting
	3-dimensional gate could resolve cells subsets much more frequent
	in one subset compared to the other; no combination of two-dimensional
	gates could accomplish this resolution. Finally, we used the algorithm
	to compare B cell populations derived from mice of different ages
	or strains, and found that the algorithm could find very subtle differences
	between the populations. CONCLUSION: Frequency Difference Gating
	is a powerful tool that automates the process of identifying events
	comprising underlying differences between samples. It is not a clustering
	tool; it is not meant to identify subsets in multidimensional space.
	Importantly, this method may reveal subtle changes in small populations
	of cells, changes that only occur simultaneously in multiple dimensions
	in such a way that identification by univariate or bivariate analyses
	is impossible. Finally, the method may significantly aid in the analysis
	of high-order multivariate data (i.e., 6-12 color flow cytometric
	analyses), where identification of differences between datasets becomes
	so time-consuming as to be impractical. Published 2001 Wiley-Liss,

	Abstract = {In 1984, the first flow cytometry data file format was proposed as
	Flow Cytometry Standard 1.0 (FCS1.0). FCS 1.0 provided a uniform
	file format allowing data acquired on one computer to be correctly
	read and interpreted on other computers running a variety of operating
	systems. That standard was modified in 1990 and adopted by the Society
	of Analytical Cytology as FCS 2.0. Here, we report on an update of
	the FCS 2.0 standard which we propose to designate FCS 3.0. We have
	retained the basic four segment structure of earlier versions (HEADER,
	TEXT, DATA and ANALYSIS) in order to maintain analysis software compatibility,
	where possible. The changes described in this proposal include a
	method to collect files larger than 100 megabytes (not possible in
	earlier versions of the standard), the inclusion of international
	characters in the TEXT portions of the file, a method of verifying
	data integrity using a 16-bit cyclic redundancy check, and increased
	keyword support for cluster analysis and time acquisition. This report
	summarizes the work of the ISAC Data File Standards Committee. The
	complete and detailed FCS 3.0 standard is available through the ISAC

	and extensible data analyses. As well, tools for electronic collaboration
	will assist the integrated access and comprehension of experiments
	to empower users to collaborate on FCM analyses. This coordinated,

@article{Suni2003,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) provides a multiparameter
	alternative to ELISPOT assays for rapid quantitation of antigen-specific
	T cells. To increase the throughput of CFC assays, we have optimized
	methods for stimulating, staining, and acquiring whole blood or PBMC
	samples in 96-well or 24-well plates. RESULTS: We have developed
	a protocol for whole blood stimulation and processing in deep-well
	24- or 96-well plates, and fresh or cryopreserved peripheral blood
	mononuclear cell (PBMC) stimulation and processing in conventional
	96-well round-bottom plates. Samples from both HIV-1-seronegative
	and HIV-1-seropositive donors were tested. We show that the percent
	response, staining intensity, and cell recovery are comparable to
	stimulation and processing in tubes using traditional methods. We
	also show the equivalence of automated gating templates to manual
	gating for CFC data analysis. CONCLUSION: When combined with flow
	cytometry analysis using an automated plate loader and an automated
	analysis algorithm, these plate-based methods provide a higher throughput
	platform for CFC, as well as reducing operator-induced variability.
	These factors will be important for processing the numbers of samples
	required in large clinical trials, and for epitope mapping of patient
	responses},

@article{Tzircotis2004,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A useful application of flow cytometry is the investigation
	of cell receptor-ligand interactions. However such analyses are often
	compromised due to problems interpreting changes in ligand binding
	where the receptor expression is not constant. Commonly, problems
	are encountered due to cell treatments resulting in altered receptor
	expression levels, or when cell lines expressing a transfected receptor
	with variable expression are being compared. To overcome this limitation
	we have developed a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that aims to automatically
	and effectively simplify flow cytometric data and perform statistical
	tests in order to provide a clearer graphical representation of results.
	RESULTS: To demonstrate the use and advantages of this new spreadsheet
	method we have investigated the binding of the transmembrane adhesion
	receptor CD44 to its ligand hyaluronan. In the first example, phorbol
	ester treatment of cells results in both increased CD44 expression
	and increased hyaluronan binding. By applying the spreadsheet method
	we effectively demonstrate that this increased ligand binding results
	from receptor activation. In the second example we have compared
	AKR1 cells transfected either with wild type CD44 (WT CD44) or a
	mutant with a truncated cytoplasmic domain (CD44-T). These two populations
	do not have equivalent receptor expression levels but by using the
	spreadsheet method hyaluronan binding could be compared without the
	need to generate single cell clones or FACS sorting the cells for
	matching CD44 expression. By this method it was demonstrated that
	hyaluronan binding requires a threshold expression of CD44 and that
	this threshold is higher for CD44-T. However, at high CD44-T expression,
	binding was equivalent to WT CD44 indicating that the cytoplasmic
	domain has a role in presenting the receptor at the cell surface
	in a form required for efficient hyaluronan binding rather than modulating
	receptor activity. CONCLUSION: Using the attached spreadsheets and
	instructions, a simple post-acquisition method for analysing bivariate
	flow cytometry data is provided. This method constitutes a straightforward
	improvement over the standard graphical output of flow cytometric
	data and has the significant advantage that ligand binding can be
	compared between cell populations irrespective of receptor expression
	levels},

	Abstract = {The term apoptosis or programmed cell death defines a genetically
